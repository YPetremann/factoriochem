[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
factoriochem-introduction=Welcome to FactorioChem! This mod is inspired by the video game SpaceChem by Zachtronics Industries.\n\nIn FactorioChem, you will be manipulating atoms and molecules to obtain the ingredients for the 6 science packs [img=item/automation-science-pack][img=item/logistic-science-pack][img=item/military-science-pack][img=item/chemical-science-pack][img=item/production-science-pack][img=item/utility-science-pack].\n\nMolecules are Factorio items, and the buildings added by this mod manipulate these molecules by splitting atoms, combining atoms, adding bonds between atoms, and removing bonds between atoms. Each building has settings to position these molecules to combine or split them.\n\nMolecules have shape, and depending on how you configure your assembly buildings to position them, the resulting reactions will cause different results. Solve open-ended puzzles around manufacturing these molecules to obtain the progressively more complicated sets of molecules you need for science.
factoriochem-molecules=Every molecule is a grid of atoms, up to 3x3. This is the largest that either dimension can be - neither dimension can be 4 or greater.\n\nWithin each molecule, all atoms are connected to each other through vertically or horizontally adjacent bonds. Any two atoms can be connected by up to 3 bonds, and any single atom can be connected by bonds up to its bond count (but not more). Bond count per atom is indicated by its color and provided in its description:\n[img=item/atom-H] white for 1 bond, [img=item/atom-O] red for 2 bonds, [img=item/atom-N] blue for 3 bonds, [img=item/atom-C] gray for 4 bonds, and [img=item/atom-He] green for 0 bonds.\n\nAtoms and molecules all have a stack limit of 1 and cannot be handcrafted. There are no recipes to convert one molecule into another - to modify molecules, you'll need to make use of Molecule Reaction buildings.\n\nBecause of the sheer number of possible molecules, simple molecule items (aside from atoms) are hidden in menus. You cannot use filter inserters or splitters to separate them - use [entity=molecule-sorter] buildings to separate them instead.
factoriochem-simple-complex-molecules=To limit how many items are generated, Factoriochem divides molecules into two categories: simple molecules and complex molecules.\n\nSimple molecules each fit all of these properties:\n- Single atoms are always simple molecules\n- Multi-atom molecules contain 2-8 atoms, and are not radical molecules: all atoms within have bonds exactly equal to their bond count\n- Molecules with 5-8 atoms consist only of [img=item/atom-H], [img=item/atom-C], [img=item/atom-N], and/or [img=item/atom-O], and can contain single and double bonds, but not triple bonds\n- Molecules with 4 atoms can contain elements up to [img=item/atom-F], with 3 atoms can contain elements up to [img=item/atom-Cl], and with 2 atoms can contain any elements\n- Molecules with 2-4 atoms can contain single, double, and triple bonds\nThere are 59,584 simple molecules and each simple molecule receives its own unique item.\n\nAll other molecules are complex molecules. Complex molecules do not get unique items - a complex molecule encodes its contents within an item that shows its basic shape. They can contain up to 9 atoms, can always form up to triple bonds, and can be multi-atom radical molecules. There are 68,574,768,928,886,778 possible complex molecules, minus the 59,584 simple molecules. There are 150 different shapes for complex molecules, and each shape gets its own item.
factoriochem-moleculifier=The [entity=moleculifier] is your entryway into molecules. Some Factorio items can be converted into molecule or atom form. Some of these molecules can also be converted back to regular item form.\n\nAt the start, only [fluid=water] can be converted to molecules, but you can unlock other item-to-molecule conversions with research.
factoriochem-buildings=The core of FactorioChem revolves around the Molecule Reaction buildings. Each type of building performs a different type of modification to molecules, configured with settings specified per building.\nBuildings receive ingredients at specific positions, via built-in loaders. Depending on where you send an ingredient, it will register at a different position in the building.\nSimilarly, each result product outputs to a different position via the built-in loaders.
factoriochem-gui=Each Molecule Reaction building comes with a side panel GUI that shows the different elements of a molecule reaction, including the input/output molecule slots and the settings that determine what reaction takes place.\n\nAll input/output slots and selector elements have tooltips explaining how they affect a reaction.
factoriochem-gui-io=The contents of a molecule reaction building will appear here. Input molecules will show up on the left. You can click a slot to take a molecule from it or insert a molecule into it. The colored marker next to a slot indicates which input belt will deposit into this slot.\nWhen a reaction runs, the inputs will disappear and the resulting molecules will appear in the slots on the right.\nAfter the reaction completes (one craft of the machine's fixed recipe), the resulting molecules will output onto the output belts (also matching the colored markers next to the slots), or if those belts are backed up, you can click a slot to transfer it to your inventory.
factoriochem-gui-selectors=These are the settings that determine how a building performs its molecule reaction. Each building type can have different types of settings (such as position of target atom, desired fission result, etc.).
factoriochem-gui-demo=In the bottom half of the panel, you can test how buildings will perform reactions on specific inputs and settings. Click the demo input slots to copy molecules from the main reaction area or your cursor. Demo settings are saved independently from the building's main reaction settings, and persist across all buildings of the same type.
factoriochem-gui-demo-copy=Click these buttons to copy the selector settings from the other reaction area. The "Copy Main" button will also copy molecules from the main Reaction section into the Demo section input slots.
factoriochem-gui-examples=Hover over the [img=virtual-signal/signal-info] to show examples of valid reactions for a building.\n\nClick the [img=utility/shuffle] button next to it to load one of the examples into the Demo section.
factoriochem-gui-tools=Click one one of these buttons to open up the tool GUI for that button (Periodic Table and Molecule Builder).\n\nYou can also open the tools via buttons in the shortcut bar.
factoriochem-gui-periodic-table=The Periodic Table shows a grid of all atoms. Hover over an atom to see its name, atomic number, and bond count.
factoriochem-gui-molecule-builder=The Molecule Builder is useful for taking a close-up look at science ingredient molecules and designing molecules to use in the demo area of molecule reaction buildings. You can build a molecule by selecting atoms and bonds, and copy the resulting molecule into a demo input slot.\n\nThe molecule you create in the builder is saved when you close the window or save+quit the game, and reloaded the next time you open the builder.
factoriochem-gui-molecule-builder-main-area=Here you can design the contents of a molecule. Click on the big buttons to set atoms, and the small buttons to set bonds.
factoriochem-gui-molecule-builder-result=This button will show your assembled molecule item, if it's valid. You can click it and then click on one of the input slots of the Molecule Reaction demo area to copy it over.\n\nThe textfield below shows the internal ID of your molecule (which you can use if you've unlocked the endgame [entity=molecule-printer]).
factoriochem-gui-molecule-builder-display-buttons=- Click on a button with a molecule to display it in the builder.\n- Click the [img=item/molecule-builder-dropper] button, and then an input or output slot of a Molecule Reaction building (either in the main area or the demo area), to copy the molecule there into the builder.\n- Click the [img=utility/deconstruction_mark] button to clear the builder.
factoriochem-gui-molecule-builder-category=- Click a science pack to show molecule display buttons for each of its ingredients.\n- Click on the Moleculifier to show molecule display buttons for one of its recipes.
factoriochem-buildings-1=- The [entity=molecule-sorter] will be your go-to building for organizing molecules, especially [entity=moleculifier] products, since most molecules cannot be filtered by splitters or filter inserters. Sorting is done by comparing against a specific atom in the input molecule: select an atom target (ex [img=item/molecule-reaction-selector-target-2100]), comparison (ex [font=default-bold]≥[/font]), and comparand atom (ex [img=item/atom-N]); molecules that completely match the comparison output at the top [img=molecule-indicator-result] and all other molecules output at the bottom [img=molecule-indicator-remainder].\n- The [entity=molecule-rotator] rotates molecules 90° left [img=item/molecule-reaction-selector-rotation-l], 180° [img=item/molecule-reaction-selector-rotation-f], or 90° right [img=item/molecule-reaction-selector-rotation-r]. You can rotate an entire molecule, or you can rotate part of a molecule by specifying where in the molecule to rotate (ex [img=item/molecule-reaction-selector-atom-bond-1200E]).
