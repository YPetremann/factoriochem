Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2023-11-10
  Changes:
    - Moved Molecule Detector to be unlocked by its own (cheap) technology to better alert players that it exists
    - Added a setting to modify how many science packs each of the recipes produce
  Ease of use:
    - Added button next to "Examples" label that loads an example into the demo
    - Added buttons to copy the main reaction to the Demo reaction and vice versa
    - Show molecule contents for simple molecules in the Molecule Reaction GUI
    - Add examples with complex molecules, only shown when settings allow complex molecules
    - More Tips-and-Tricks entries
      - Demo copy buttons
      - Molecule Reaction buildings
      - Sorting molecules with filter inserters and splitters
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed sorter demos not working with the default comparatison selector state
    - Added a workaround to be able to pipette-select a building ghost if it's behind a building-settings ghost
    - Fixed Intra-Molecule Mutator ignoring a target fusion catalyst if the selector wasn't specified
  Compatibility:
    - Fixed buildings getting built/revived/destroyed by other scripts (for mods that raise script_raise_*** events)
    - Moved the removal of the "logistics" technology to data-updates.lua for compatibility with mods that use it as a prerequisite technology in data.lua
