- Achievements
	- "FactorioChem - Pure simplicity" - Launch a rocket without ever creating a complex molecule
	- "FactorioChem - Only one step at a time" - Launch a rocket without using fission or fusion in any Debonder, Bonder, Severer, or Splicer buildings
- Mod settings
	- Compatibility mode that doesn't modify sciences
	- Have sciences take complex molecules; those molecules will actually generate as simple molecules
	- Disable simple molecules for faster loading
	- Free buildings: all new buildings can be crafted for free
	- Require power: new buildings need 100kW (after solving issue of reduced power recipe workload)
	- GUI to show you all of your demo'd and cached machine reactions
- Double Rotator building - "atom-bond" on base, "atom-bond" on catalyst, specifies an atom to move pointing at its bond to move, second atom-bond specifies its new orientation relative to the first selector
- Split reaction buildings into a separate mod
