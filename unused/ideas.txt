- Achievements
	- "FactorioChem - Pure simplicity" - Launch a rocket without ever creating a complex molecule
	- "FactorioChem - Only one step at a time" - Launch a rocket without using fission or fusion in any Debonder, Bonder, Severer, or Splicer buildings
- Tips and tricks
	- Introduction
	- Molecules, atoms, and bonds
	- Fission / Fusion
- Mod settings
	- Have sciences take complex molecules; those molecules will actually generate as simple molecules
	- Disable simple molecules for faster loading
	- Free buildings: all new buildings can be crafted for free
	- Require power: new buildings need 100kW (after solving issue of reduced power recipe workload)
- Products table returned from reaction, used as the cache table and copied into the reaction
- GUI to show you all of your demo'd and cached machine reactions
- Double Rotator building - "atom-bond" on base, "atom-bond" on catalyst, specifies an atom to move pointing at its bond to move, second atom-bond specifies its new orientation relative to the first selector
- Split reaction buildings into a separate "Dynamic Recipe Assemblers" mod
